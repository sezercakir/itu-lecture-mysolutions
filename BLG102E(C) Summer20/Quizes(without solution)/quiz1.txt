"The Drunk Bridge" is connecting the East of the city to the West of it.  

A drunk person is left in the middle of a bridge facing West. 

The person's home is at the end of the West side of the bridge. 

The size of the bridge is 10m by 4m. (10m in the East-West Direction.)

Since the person is drunk random steps are taken in four directions.

(East, West, South, North) with different step sizes:

40cm to the East, 70cm to the West, 30 cm to the South and to the North.

 

Write a program to simulate the random walk of the drunk person. 

 

Determine the number of steps the person will walk before steping off the bridge or reaching at either end of the bridge and print on screen.

 

Run the simulation for 1000 times and print the number of times that the drunk person is

reaching at home  (ex 32)

reaching to the wrong end of the bridge (ex 937)

stepping off the bridge (ex 31)

on screen.
